thirst
======

If you ever wanted to:

    Pub.find

to get the nearest decent pub - then this gem is for you. Just:

    gem install thirst

and integrate it in whatever application you need it in. Currently you can get all pubs with:

    require 'thirst'
    Pub.all

Each pub has a name, a latitude and a longitude. More will come later.

===========

The gem is backed up with pubs in Sweden from the list maintained by Svenska Ölfrämjandet. If you feel you need this for your own country go ahead and contribute.
